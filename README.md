As a contemporary dancer and a Makers graduate, looking through a new way of creativity, I was struck by how free and expressive coding is, allowing to bring art into life through different forms. 

At Makers Academy, I learnt key skills and best coding practices, including object-oriented programming, test-driven development, pair programming, and the ability to efficiently learn new programming languages. 

I feel continuously aspired by the coding community where you get to practice growth mindset, the warmth of support and how welcoming - I feel a sense of where I belong.
